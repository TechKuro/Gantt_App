# Example Scripts

This directory contains standalone example scripts that demonstrate Gantt chart concepts.
These are **not** part of the main application and are kept here for reference.

## Files

### `Gantt_Chart.py`
A simple standalone Gantt chart example using matplotlib with hardcoded project phases.
Demonstrates basic bar chart creation with date formatting and weekend shading.

### `Renderplas.py`
Another standalone example showing work-day-based Gantt chart rendering.
Demonstrates calculation of work days (excluding weekends) and chart creation.

## Usage

These scripts can be run independently:

```bash
python examples/Gantt_Chart.py
python examples/Renderplas.py
```

They will display a matplotlib window with the example Gantt chart.
